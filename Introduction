The minimum density power divergence estimator is a very well known method in robust statistical inference which can withstand the presence of outliers in the data and 
a few model misspecifications (Refer to "Robust and efficient estimation by minimising a density power divergence", for further theoretical details) and is known to
provide superior performance, in such instances, as opposed to the method of maximum likelihood estimation. My work consists of the application of this method on 
longitudinal data with discrete outcomes and its comparison with the method of pairwise maximum likelihood estimation (as suggested in "DISCRETE LONGITUDINAL DATA
MODELING WITH A MEAN-CORRELATION REGRESSION APPROACH"). 

The files in the repository contain all the pieces of code (implemented in R programming language) that were written to apply the above mentioned method on longitudinal 
data with discrete outcomes. These codes primarily consist of simulations, calculation of the asymptotic properties of the estimator, application on some real data sets.
The files have been arranged in the following manner:

1) Simulation study for the pairwise minimum density power divergence estimator (MDPDE) on pure data (with binary outcomes)
2) Simulation study for the pairwise MDPDE on contaminated data (with contaminated binary responses)
3) Simulation study for the pairwise maximum likelihood estimator on pure data
4) Simulation study for the pairwise maximum likelihood estimator on contaminated data
5) Calculation of the asymptotic properties of the pairwise MDPDE
6) Application of both these methods on Toenail infection data
7) Application of both these methods on Locust data (by MacDonald and Raubenheimer)
8) Application of both these methods on PBC Mayo liver data
