# Minimum-density-power-divergence-estimation-in-longitudinal-data-
This repository is a documentation of all the codes that have been written to implement a robust method in statistcal inference called "Minimum density power divergence
estimation" on longitudinal data with discrete outcomes. The codes were written to conduct simulation study, real data analysis and calculation of the asymptotic 
properties. I have specifically worked on two types of responses in the longitudinal study, which are binary and count responses. Logistic regression and Poisson 
regression have been applied to deal with binary and count responses respectively.
The reader is advised to follow the file called "Introduction" to understand the flow of the repository.
