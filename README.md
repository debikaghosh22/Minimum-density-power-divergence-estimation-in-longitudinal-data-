# Minimum-density-power-divergence-estimation-in-longitudinal-data-
The minimum density power divergence estimation is a method in robust statistical inference based on the minimization of distances between two densities which is known 
to perform well in the presence of outliers or extreme values in a data set. Some of the items in the following list may be refered to for understanding the theory behind this method and its applications.

1) Robust and efficient estimation by minimising a density power divergence 
2) Robust estimation for independent non-homogeneous observations using density power divergence with applications to linear regression
3) Robust Wald-type tests for non-homogeneous observations based on the minimum density power divergence estimator
4) Robust Density Power Divergence Estimates for Panel Data Models
5) DISCRETE LONGITUDINAL DATA MODELING WITH A MEAN-CORRELATION REGRESSION APPROACH

This repository is a documentation of all the codes that have been written to implement this robust method in statistcal inference called "Minimum density power divergence estimation" on longitudinal data with discrete outcomes. The codes were written to conduct simulation study, real data analysis and calculation of the asymptotic properties. I have specifically worked on two types of responses in the longitudinal study, namely binary and count responses. Logistic regression and Poisson regression have been applied to deal with binary and count responses respectively.
The reader is advised to follow the file called "Introduction" to understand the flow of the repository.
